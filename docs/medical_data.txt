Diabetes is a chronic medical condition characterized by high blood sugar levels. It occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin or use it effectively. There are two main types: Type 1 and Type 2.

Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition in which the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high. It can lead to heart diseases if untreated.

Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.

Paracetamol is a common painkiller used to treat aches and pains. It can also be used to reduce a high temperature (fever).

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.
